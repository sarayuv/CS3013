Project 2
Sarayu Vijayanagaram

This project utilizes threads and locks to simulate sport activities between baseball and football teams on Worcester Gompei Field. The original problem requires a rugby implementation, however, I only reached the baseball and football implementations. More information about how I approached this problem can be found in problem_explanation.txt.
