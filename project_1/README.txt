README PROJECT 1
Sarayu Vijayanagaram

I have included comments that came from my pseudocode throughout the c code files. To keep track of background jobs, I created forks off of parents and stored the PIDs in some sort of pid_t variable. In some cases, arrays might have been used. Throughout the project, I first checked if a PID was assigned to a child (pid == 0). After that, I would check and apply any methods to the parents (pid > 0).
To test my programs, I would use perror() and printf() statements to determine what the cause of the error was after running a specific section.
I was not able to finish slugrace.c but have included the code I have so far as part of a block comment in that file.
